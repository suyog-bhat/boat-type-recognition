# Boat-type-recognition
TITLE OF THE PROJECT: Boat type Recognition.

GETTING STARTED: These instruction will get you a copy of the project and running on any machine.

PREREQUISITES:Tensorflow,Keras and other python libraries.

DATASET:https://www.kaggle.com/clorichel/boat-types-recognition

HOW TO RUN:

This machine learning course project is Boat type clssification. Boat Dataset is present in the given link. Boat type classes are present in the sub directories. ml_model_build.py file contains the code for building the neural network which loads old model oh .h5 file extension if present else it will create new model file, later saves it as checkpoints. Before running the code make sure you comment load_model line as there is no saved model.Prediction.py contains the code for trained model loading and feeding the image to the model and predicting the class of image. To predict the type of the boat give the image path to the code and run.
